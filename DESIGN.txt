## Design

### Web Presentation Layer
 - Using MVC: ContractBean, ProductBean, RevenueRecognitionBean are the models.
 - Using Template View (JSPs): index.jsp, contractList.jsp, contract.jsp, productList.jsp, product.jsp are the views.
 - Using Page Controller (Servlets): ContractsController, ProductsController are the controllers.

### Business Logic Layer
 - Using Domain Model (Beans): ContractBean, ProductBean, RevenueRecognitionBean hold the data state.

### Data Source Layer
 - Using Data Mapper (ORM): ContractMapper, ProductMapper, RevenueRecognitionMapper bridge the connection between
    the domain model objects and the database tables & rows.

### Revenue Recognition strategies
 - Using the Strategy pattern: CompleteRecognitionStrategy & ThreeWayRecognitionStrategy both conform to the interface
    given in RecognitionStrategy. Regardless of the implementation, each contract can call calculateRevenueRecognitions()
    and the computation will be delegated to the appropriate strategy.
